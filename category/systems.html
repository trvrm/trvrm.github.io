                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> We had a PHP report that takes around 45 seconds to render.  To give the user feedback
that their report was actually being generated, I wanted to change our PHP installation to deliver at least some output to the client as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the entire page was rendered.</p>
<p>In general, PHP and NGINX work hard to buffer output, so this was mostly an exercise in fighting with
PHP and NGINX to make them stop doing optimizations that do, in general, make sense.  It turns out that
to do this, we had to make changes at three levels of our software stack: in our PHP code,
in our PHP configuration settings, and in our NGINX configuration.</p>
<h4>PHP changes</h4>
<p>I added this at the top of the file in question:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ob_implicit_flush(1);
</pre></div>


<p>This tells PHP to simulate calling <code>flush()</code> after every output block.</p>
<h4>PHP INI changes</h4>
<p>I added a new .ini file in <code>/etc/php5/fpm/conf.d</code> with the following setting:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>output_buffering = Off
</pre></div>


<p>This tells PHP not to buffer output.</p>
<h4>NGINX changes</h4>
<p>In the .conf file for the reporting site, I added</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>fastcgi_keep_conn on;
gzip off;
</pre></div>


<p>in the location block, and</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ssl_buffer_size 1k;
</pre></div>


<p>in the server block. This last one took me a while to figure out - it defaults
to 16k, and even with all the other changes made, when accessing the site via
HTTPS, NGINX will still buffer your output.</p>

                <p>I've mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://fabric.readthedocs.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a> before on this blog.  Because so much of my development time is spent in Python, it makes
sense for me to look for system administration tools that are also written in Python.  Fabric fits the bill
perfectly, and allows me to run tasks remotely on multiple machines simultaneously.</p>
<p>A useful addition to Fabric is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sebastien/cuisine">Cuisine</a>.  <strong>Cuisine is a small set of functions that sit on top of Fabric,
to abstract common administration operations such as file/dir operations, user/group creation,
package install/upgrade, making it easier to write portable administration and deployment scripts.</strong></p>

            </h2>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <p>I have a large, complex <a class="reference external" href="/postfix.html">mailing system</a> that processes
a significant amount of data every hour.  While I'm developing it, I want to know
what it's doing, and whether it's having any problems.  So I use the excellent
python <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html">logging</a> library to produce comprehensive monitoring data.</p>
<p>The only problem is that these log files can get pretty big.  And because I don't
know ahead of time when I'm going to need to hunt through them, I tend to leave
the logging system in a fairly verbose state.</p>
<p>Enter <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/">logrotate</a>.  This is a standard service on Ubuntu that regularly rotates
your log files, throwing away old data, compressing middle-age data, and leaving
young log files fresh and accessible.  Thus you are protected from
runaway log file growth and nasty calls in the middle of the night from your
monitoring service telling you that your server just died because the hard
drives were full.</p>
<p>A default ubuntu installation comes with logrotate already set up for various services.
If you don't have it, install it with <code class="code">
apt-get install logrotate</code>
, and
then it's mostly just a question of copying a file from <code class="code">
/etc/logrotate.d/</code>

and modifying it according to your needs.</p>
<p><code class="code">
vi /etc/logrotate.d/myservice</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>/var/log/myservice/*.log <span class="o">{</span>
  rotate 7
  daily
  compress
  missingok
  notifempty
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that's it!  The actually invocation of the <code class="code">
logrotate</code>
 command will
get triggered regularly by a script in /etc/cron.daily</p>
<p>You can also <strong>force</strong> a rotation, a useful option when testing out a new configuration,
via</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/myservice
</pre></div>
<p>One quick word of warning: if you're using the python <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html">logging</a> library, then
you'll want to use the <code class="code">
WatchedFileHandler</code>
 class.  If the logfile gets
rotated out while it's in use, WatchedFileHandler will notice this, close the file
stream and open a new one.</p>

            </h2>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <p>The documentation for Nginx and UWSGI is long and complex, but with ubuntu 14
it's actually pretty straightforward to get them up and running.</p>
<p>I present here a a setup that uses nginx and uwsgi emperor to host
multiple python web applications simultaneously on an ubuntu 14 machine.</p>
<p>First, the packages</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ sudo apt-get install nginx
$ sudo apt-get install uwsgi uwsgi-emperor uwsgi-plugin-python
</pre></div>
<p>Our configuration files will now be under <code class="code">
/etc/nginx</code>
 and <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor</code>
</p>
<p>You can start, stop, and reload nginx as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ sudo service nginx start
$ sudo service nginx stop
$ sudo service nginx reload
</pre></div>
<p>The last command is useful when changing configuration settings.</p>
<p>Now set up a site by creating a file in <code class="code">
/etc/nginx/sites-available</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">#/etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite</span>
server<span class="o">{</span>

    server_name     your_host_name<span class="p">;</span>

    location /app1 <span class="o">{</span>
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/app1.socket<span class="p">;</span>
        include uwsgi_params<span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    location /app2 <span class="o">{</span>
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/app2.socket<span class="p">;</span>
        include uwsgi_params<span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Then,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/apps-available/mysite /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
</pre></div>
<div class="alert  alert-warning compound">
<p class="compound-first"><strong>Warning</strong></p>
<p class="compound-last">A previous version of this tutorial had the sockets placed in <code class="code">
/run/uwsgi</code>
.
This was a mistake, because under Ubuntu <code class="code">
/run</code>
 is mounted as a <code class="code">
tmpfs</code>
, and its content will be deleted on reboot
Your uwsgi sub-directory will vanish and the uwsgi services will not restart.</p>
</div>
<p>Next, set up your 'vassals' (<a class="reference external" href="http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Emperor.html">http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Emperor.html</a>)</p>
<p>Create  <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/app1.ini</code>
 as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">[uwsgi]</span>
<span class="na">plugin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">python</span>
<span class="na">processes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">2</span>
<span class="na">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/tmp/app1.socket</span>
<span class="na">chmod-socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">666</span>

<span class="na">chdir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app1</span>
<span class="na">wsgi-file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app1/main.py</span>

<span class="na">uid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
<span class="na">gid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And for your second application, create  <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/app2.ini</code>
 as similarly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">[uwsgi]</span>
<span class="na">plugin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">python</span>
<span class="na">processes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">2</span>
<span class="na">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/tmp/app2.socket</span>
<span class="na">chmod-socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">666</span>

<span class="na">chdir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app1</span>
<span class="na">wsgi-file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app2/main.py</span>

<span class="na">uid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
<span class="na">gid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The simple act of <em>creating</em> or touching a .ini file in <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals</code>
 will cause
the emperor process to try to restart your application.</p>
<p>Of course, your applications don't exist yet, so let's create them.  The simplest wsgi
application can be only a few lines long:</p>
<p>Create <code class="code">
/srv/app1/main.py</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;200 OK&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;text/html&#39;</span><span class="p">)])</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello World, I am app1&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And <code class="code">
/srv/app2/main.py</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;200 OK&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;text/html&#39;</span><span class="p">)])</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;I, however, am app2. &quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>Visiting <a class="reference external" href="http://your_host_name/app1">http://your_host_name/app1</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://your_host_name/app2">http://your_host_name/app2</a> should return the text

                </a>
            </h2>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <p>Postfix is a ghastly horror that really should be quietly eliminated.  But that truism hides a deeper issue - email itself is a ghastly horror, the result of 30 years of hacks, edge-cases, non-conformant implementations and competing design constraints, that only persists because we still haven't come up with anything better.</p>
<p>Take the simple question 'what is a valid email address'.</p>
<p>I have a couple of standard regexes I use to validate email addresses,
such as <code class="code">
^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+&#64;[A-Z0-9.-]+ .[A-Z]{2,4}$</code>
,
but having spent years building mailing systems,
the best answer I can come up with is
<em>a valid email address is one that gets delivered to its destination</em>.</p>
<p>So, Postfix.  If you ever need a taste of purgatory, take some time to browse through
the source code, a terrifying mix of old-school C and Perl.  I once needed to create
a utility to monitor the state of a Postfix DEFERRED queue, and found it was vastly
easier to write my own queue parser in Python than understand the source to the existing
<code class="code">
qshape</code>
 utility.  Whoever wrote that clearly has an aversion to variable names
that are more than one character long.</p>
<p>Actually configuring a functional Postfix system requires commiting yourself to a long
pilgrimage across the net, picking up scattered bits of wisdom from the hardy travellers
who have passed this way before, and recorded their insights in ancient forgotten blog
posts and wiki pages.</p>
<p>Documents such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.howtoforge.com/virtual-users-domains-postfix-courier-mysql-squirrelmail-ubuntu-10.04">http://www.howtoforge.com/virtual-users-domains-postfix-courier-mysql-squirrelmail-ubuntu-10.04</a>
include gems like <em>'this howto is meant as a practical guide; it does not cover the
theoretical backgrounds'</em>.</p>
<p>You have been warned, it seems to be saying.  Configuring this system really requires at
the very least a Masters degree in Advanced Email Hackery.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9454"><img alt="postfix flowchart" src="images/postfix_flowchart.jpg" /></a>
<p>That image is from this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9454">article</a> at Linux Journal, which is actually
a pretty good and comprehensive introduction to the architecture of Postfix</p>
<p>The <em>key</em> insight that everything else hangs on is that Postfix is <em>not</em> a program.  Postfix is a large
<em>collection</em> of programs: some of which interact with the user, and a large number which run in the
background and perform all the various tasks of gathering, processing and delivering email.</p>
<p>These programs, together with a rather complex set of folders under <code class="code">
/var/spool/postfix</code>
 that store messages as they work their way through
the system, and another set of rather complex configuration files under <code class="code">
/etc/postfix</code>
, are what comprises the
complete mail delivery system.</p>
<p>To add to the fun, many postfix configuration settings can be stored in MySQL, and it's possible to run multiple postfix instances in
parallel with each other.</p>

<p>That's a lot of processes....</p>
<p>And yet, despite this, Postfix seems to be about the best there is.  Over the last
few years I've built and maintained a massively parallel mail delivery, management
and monitoring system on top of Postfix that, at the last count, had successfully
delivered almost 10 million messages for clients of <a class="reference external" href="http://nooro.com">Nooro Online Research</a>.</p>

                <p>A tool I'm finding myself using more and more these days is <a class="reference external" href="http://fabric.readthedocs.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a>.</p>
<p>Fabric is a python utility and library for streamlining systems administration
tasks on multiple machines.</p>
<p>Although I'm primarily a developer and systems architect, I find that as our
company grows I keep getting drawn into sysadmin and devops tasks.   We now
have quite a number of servers which I need to monitor and manage.</p>
<p>Now, as Larry Wall so profoundly said, one of the great virtues of a programmer
is <em>laziness</em>, so if there's a way I can perform the same task on multiple machines
without having to manually type out the commands dozens of times, then I'm all for it.</p>
<p>Fabric does precisely that.  It's written in Python, and its configuration files
are python scripts, so there's no need to learn yet another domain-specific language.
I have a file called <code class="code">
fabfile.py</code>
 on my local machine that contains a growing
collection of little recipes, and with this I can interact with all the servers
in our infrastructure.</p>
<p>So for example, if I want to see at a glance which version of linux I'm running on
all my servers, I have a task set up in my fabfile like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@parallel</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">lsb_release</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;lsb_release -a&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When I invoke this via:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ fab lsb_release
</pre></div>
<p>I get a nice little print-out of the current version of all my servers.  Fabric
runs the task in parallel against every host in the <code class="code">
env.hosts</code>
 variable,
which can be set at the command line or in the <strong>fabfile</strong>.</p>
<p>The following example allows me to see a list of every database running on every
database server.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">DATABASE_HOST_MACHINES</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;dbserver1&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;dbserver2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nd">@hosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DATABASE_HOST_MACHINES</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">databases</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">warn_only</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;psql -c &quot;select datname from pg_database;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And <em>voila</em>, a call to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ fab databases
</pre></div>
<p>gives me a company-wide view of all our databases.</p>
<p>One further demonstration - this blog itself is generated using Fabric! For details, see
