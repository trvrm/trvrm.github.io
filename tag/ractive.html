            <hr>
            <div class="content ">
                <p>I've used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ractivejs.org/">Ractive</a> for several projects recently.
It's been like a breath of fresh air.  I've been writing user interfaces of one
kind or another for more than a decade, and keeping <em>what's displayed to the user</em>
in sync with <em>what's stored in the data structures</em> has often been a source of
frustration.</p>
<p>In the javascript world, I've mostly used <a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone</a>  and
<a class="reference external" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for creating interactive web pages.  While these
tools are very good at what they do, I still find myself writing a fair amount
of code to update data in the model whenever a user interacts with a control, and
to update the control displays whenever data in the model changes.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Ractive</strong>.  It's not the only library to handle 2-way data binding - Angular,
Knockout and React all play in this space, but it's my current favourite.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a little demo....</p>
<p>Given a ractive template like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Type in the boxes below.<span class="err">&lt;</span>\p&gt;
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-control&quot;</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{var1}}&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;form-control&quot;</span> <span class="na">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{var2}}&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Current values are var1:<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{var1}}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>, var2:<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>{{var2}}<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">button</span> <span class="na">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;</span> <span class="na">on-click</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;changeme&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Set var1<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">button</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and javascript like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ractive</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Ractive</span><span class="p">({</span>
   <span class="nx">el</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;#demo&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="nx">template</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nx">template</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">var1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s1">&#39;beeblebrox&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nx">var2</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="s1">&#39;lintilla&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We get:</p>
<script src='//cdn.ractivejs.org/latest/ractive.js'></script>

<div id="demo" class="well"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">

     var template='<p>Type in the boxes below.<\p> \
                  <input class="form-control" value="{{var1}}">  \
                  <input class="form-control" value="{{var2}}">  \
                  <p>Current values are var1:<code>{{var1}}</code>, var2:<code>{{var2}}</p>\
                  <br><button class="btn btn-primary" on-click="changeme">Set var1</button>';

     var ractive = new Ractive({
        el:"#demo",
        template:template,
        data:{var1:'beeblebrox',var2:'lintilla'}
     });

     ractive.on('changeme',function(){
        ractive.set('var1','zarniwoop');
     });
</script><p>Neat, huh?  I haven't had to write any code to manually react to keyup, or change events
in the input controls - Ractive simply takes care of the fact that I refer to <code class="code">
var1</code>

in both the output paragraph and the control value, and binds the two elements together,
refreshing them whenever needed.</p>
<p>The code for responding to the button click is simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">ractive</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;changeme&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
    <span class="nx">ractive</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;var1&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;zarniwoop&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>By setting data in the underlying model, the user interface automatically updates,
again without any manual intervention.</p>
<div class="section" id="ui-development-might-be-fun-again">
<h2>UI development might be fun again....</h2>
<p>I have the same feeling on discovering Ractive that I had when I was first shown
jQuery.  All of a sudden, a bunch of boring, fiddly manual tasks are taken care
of in an intuitive way.  And unlike other frameworks, <em>all</em> ractive does is data-binding.
It doesn't try to be a control library, an AJAX toolkit or a Model-View-Controller
framework.  For those who like all-in-one solutions, this will be a weakness, but as
someone who believes in the unix philosophy of building systems from tools that
each do one thing well, I'm very impressed.</p>

            <hr>
            <div class="content ">
                <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ractivejs.org/">Ractive.js</a> caught my eye this week.  I've been using <a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for the last couple
of years to develop single page client-side applications, and I've liked how
it doesn't get in your way, but simply allows you to get on with your work.</p>
<p>When I noticed that three of the tools I was using: Coffeescript, Underscore, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> were all written by the same guy, I realised that Jeremy Ashkenas
is a seriously genius level developer.  I've loved working with his tools; and I
love the fact that the code that he produces is so readable.  I'm always more comfortable
working with a library when I can read through the entire source code if I run
into problems.  Check out the nicely annotated source code for Backbone, for example,
here: <a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html">http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html</a></p>
<p>(On that note, I love working with <a class="reference external" href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/_modules/bottle.html">Bottle</a> for exactly the same reason - the entire
framework is contained in a single, very readable, Python file.)</p>
<p>But one problem that comes up time and time again, no matter what library or framework
you're using, is the problem of binding data to controls.  Currently in my Backbone-based
code I have event handling code that reacts to user input and updates the model, and
I have more code that reacts to changes in the data model and updates the UI.  Wouldn't
it be nice if this two-way data binding could happen automatically?  Wouldn't it be
nice, for example, if you could do something like this:</p>
<p>Imagine having a user interface like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;checkbox&#39;</span> <span class="na">checked</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;{{visible}}&#39;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> visible?
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And underlying data like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;visible&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And imagine if all the data binding was handled for you, so that clicking on the checkbox
will automatically change the value of the underlying javascript object, and changing
the value of the object via <code class="code">
ractive.set('visible',true)</code>
 updated the interface.</p>
<p>That is exactly what Ractive does.  I haven't tried using it in production yet, but
at the moment it feels like the next logical iteration in javascript frameworks.</p>
<p>I was busy using Backbone heavily when Angular and Knockout came out, so I don't have
much experience with them, but asking around the shop the consensus seems to be that
Ractive looks significantly nicer to use than Knockout.</p>
<p>And the best feature so far is their <em>awesome</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://learn.ractivejs.org/hello-world/1/">tutorial</a>.  This is, apparently, entirely
written in Ractive, and guides you step by step through all the basic concepts of
the library in an elegant, interactive fashion.  No more jumping through package installations
and dependency hell before you can try out a new framework.  <em>This</em> is the way to
introduce people to your work.  I'm very impressed.</p>
