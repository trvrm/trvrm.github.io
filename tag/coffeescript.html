                <p>Through a bizarre twist of history, the entire client-side web runs on a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Netscape_and_JavaScript">language</a>
that was thrown together in 10 days.</p>
<p>Despite huge investments in their own proprietary technology by the likes of Sun
Microsystems, Adobe and Microsoft, this weird little spinoff of <strong>self</strong> and <strong>scheme</strong>
is everywhere, while client-side Java, ActiveX and Flash fade into obscurity.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a language developed so quickly, Javascript is pretty ugly.
I'm fond of saying that it's a horrible language, with a really nice language
inside trying to get out.  It gets some things, like scoping rules, very, very
wrong.  But it got other things, like anonymous functions, exactly right, long before
they were adopted in Java, C#, or C++.  Even Python, my favourite language ever,
doesn't get them quite right.</p>
<p>Several people have attempted to build a nicer syntax on top of the javascript
virtual machine.  In fact, the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS">list</a> of languages that compile to JS is startlingly
big.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years I've been using <a class="reference external" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> as my standard javascript syntax.</p>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always
had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the
good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>and I think it achieves this admirably.  It doesn't solve <em>all</em> of javascript's problems -
you can still get into trouble with the Infamous Loop Problem, but it does make the language
considerably more succinct, mostly by stealing ideas from Python and Haskell.</p>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Function definitions go from</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">x</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">d = </span><span class="nf">(x) -&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">x</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This makes for very quick object construction:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">math =</span>
    <span class="nv">root: </span>  <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sqrt</span>
    <span class="nv">square: </span><span class="nx">square</span>
    <span class="nv">cube: </span>  <span class="nf">(x) -&gt;</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">square</span> <span class="nx">x</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It also borrows Python's list comprehension syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">values</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">option</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">value</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">option</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">question</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The near complete absense of curly brackets saves a lot of wasted lines in
my source code, and enables me to see what's going on a lot clearer than in raw
javascript.  On the downside, I do find myself fairly regularly testing out code
snippets in the <a class="reference external" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> online compiler to make sure that I've properly understood
how they will be interpreted.</p>
<p>Because CoffeeScript is a compiled language, to work with it effectively requires
integrating the compiler into your toolchain.  For my larger projects I've hand-written
a tool using Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog">Watchdog</a> package to monitor my source code directories and
output compiled javascript everytime a file changes.</p>
<p>As a nice little extra, my tool jams in a warning message wrapped in an <code class="code">
alert</code>
 call
if the compliation fails, so if I introduce a syntax error in my coffeescript, as soon
as I refresh the page that is using it I'll be presented with the source of the problem.</p>
