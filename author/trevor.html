                <h2><a href="/pelican-atom-and-markdown.html">Pelican, Atom and Markdown</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    <p>I've been using reStructured text in general to write this blog, but I think I'm
going to be switching to Markdown.  As an experiment, I'm writing this post in Markdown.</p>
<p>I'm also writing it in the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>, which has really come on a
long way since I last tried it.  Specifically, it includes a Markdown preview function, so
I can see the effects of the markup that I'm writing as I write it.</p>
<p>Mostly, I want a rapid way of creating and publishing code snippets, without the mental
overhead of switching between markup languages. Although reStructured text and markdown
are broadly similar, there are subtle differences between them when it comes to things
like syntax highlighting.  But I've discovered today that if I use the triple-backtick
syntax, I can get the same output from Pelican, Atom, and IPython notebooks.</p>
<p>So</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    ```python
    def syntax(highlighting=True):
        return &quot;cool huh?&quot;
    ```
</pre></div>


<p>yields</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">syntax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">highlighting</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;cool huh?&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And if I paste that into a markdown cell in an IPython notebook, I get the same effect, as
can be seen <a href="https://github.com/trvrm/notebooks/blob/master/Markdown%20Demo.ipynb">here</a></p>
<p>So this seems to be the general way that the open-source ecosystem is going: Markdown
allows me to use the same syntax for my GitHub documentation, my IPython notebooks, and
my blog posts.  </p>
<p>I do use <strong>Sphinx</strong> in various places for Python code documentation, so that will still
require reStructured text, but elsewhere I think Markdown is the way to go</p>

<p>My first attempt used grequests, but apparently that's not even necessary.</p>
<p>I guess that the call to monkey.patch_all() even patches the socket code
that requests uses.  I'm very impressed.</p>

                <h2><a href="/coffeescript.html">CoffeeScript</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    <p>Through a bizarre twist of history, the entire client-side web runs on a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Netscape_and_JavaScript">language</a>
that was thrown together in 10 days.</p>
<p>Despite huge investments in their own proprietary technology by the likes of Sun
Microsystems, Adobe and Microsoft, this weird little spinoff of <strong>self</strong> and <strong>scheme</strong>
is everywhere, while client-side Java, ActiveX and Flash fade into obscurity.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a language developed so quickly, Javascript is pretty ugly.
I'm fond of saying that it's a horrible language, with a really nice language
inside trying to get out.  It gets some things, like scoping rules, very, very
wrong.  But it got other things, like anonymous functions, exactly right, long before
they were adopted in Java, C#, or C++.  Even Python, my favourite language ever,
doesn't get them quite right.</p>
<p>Several people have attempted to build a nicer syntax on top of the javascript
virtual machine.  In fact, the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS">list</a> of languages that compile to JS is startlingly
big.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years I've been using <a class="reference external" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> as my standard javascript syntax.</p>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always
had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the
good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>and I think it achieves this admirably.  It doesn't solve <em>all</em> of javascript's problems -
you can still get into trouble with the Infamous Loop Problem, but it does make the language
considerably more succinct, mostly by stealing ideas from Python and Haskell.</p>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Function definitions go from</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">x</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">d = </span><span class="nf">(x) -&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">x</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This makes for very quick object construction:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">math =</span>
    <span class="nv">root: </span>  <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sqrt</span>
    <span class="nv">square: </span><span class="nx">square</span>
    <span class="nv">cube: </span>  <span class="nf">(x) -&gt;</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">square</span> <span class="nx">x</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It also borrows Python's list comprehension syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">values</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">option</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">value</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nx">option</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">question</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The near complete absense of curly brackets saves a lot of wasted lines in
my source code, and enables me to see what's going on a lot clearer than in raw
javascript.  On the downside, I do find myself fairly regularly testing out code
snippets in the <a class="reference external" href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> online compiler to make sure that I've properly understood
how they will be interpreted.</p>
<p>Because CoffeeScript is a compiled language, to work with it effectively requires
integrating the compiler into your toolchain.  For my larger projects I've hand-written
a tool using Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watchdog">Watchdog</a> package to monitor my source code directories and
output compiled javascript everytime a file changes.</p>
<p>As a nice little extra, my tool jams in a warning message wrapped in an <code class="code">
alert</code>
 call
if the compliation fails, so if I introduce a syntax error in my coffeescript, as soon
as I refresh the page that is using it I'll be presented with the source of the problem.</p>

                    <p>I've mentioned <a class="reference external" href="http://fabric.readthedocs.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a> before on this blog.  Because so much of my development time is spent in Python, it makes
sense for me to look for system administration tools that are also written in Python.  Fabric fits the bill
perfectly, and allows me to run tasks remotely on multiple machines simultaneously.</p>
<p>A useful addition to Fabric is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sebastien/cuisine">Cuisine</a>.  <strong>Cuisine is a small set of functions that sit on top of Fabric,
to abstract common administration operations such as file/dir operations, user/group creation,
package install/upgrade, making it easier to write portable administration and deployment scripts.</strong></p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    <p>I have a large, complex <a class="reference external" href="/postfix.html">mailing system</a> that processes
a significant amount of data every hour.  While I'm developing it, I want to know
what it's doing, and whether it's having any problems.  So I use the excellent
python <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html">logging</a> library to produce comprehensive monitoring data.</p>
<p>The only problem is that these log files can get pretty big.  And because I don't
know ahead of time when I'm going to need to hunt through them, I tend to leave
the logging system in a fairly verbose state.</p>
<p>Enter <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/">logrotate</a>.  This is a standard service on Ubuntu that regularly rotates
your log files, throwing away old data, compressing middle-age data, and leaving
young log files fresh and accessible.  Thus you are protected from
runaway log file growth and nasty calls in the middle of the night from your
monitoring service telling you that your server just died because the hard
drives were full.</p>
<p>A default ubuntu installation comes with logrotate already set up for various services.
If you don't have it, install it with <code class="code">
apt-get install logrotate</code>
, and
then it's mostly just a question of copying a file from <code class="code">
/etc/logrotate.d/</code>

and modifying it according to your needs.</p>
<p><code class="code">
vi /etc/logrotate.d/myservice</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>/var/log/myservice/*.log <span class="o">{</span>
  rotate 7
  daily
  compress
  missingok
  notifempty
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that's it!  The actually invocation of the <code class="code">
logrotate</code>
 command will
get triggered regularly by a script in /etc/cron.daily</p>
<p>You can also <strong>force</strong> a rotation, a useful option when testing out a new configuration,
via</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/myservice
</pre></div>
<p>One quick word of warning: if you're using the python <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html">logging</a> library, then
you'll want to use the <code class="code">
WatchedFileHandler</code>
 class.  If the logfile gets
rotated out while it's in use, WatchedFileHandler will notice this, close the file
stream and open a new one.</p>

                <div class="entry-content">

                    <p>I've used <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ractivejs.org/">Ractive</a> for several projects recently.
It's been like a breath of fresh air.  I've been writing user interfaces of one
kind or another for more than a decade, and keeping <em>what's displayed to the user</em>
in sync with <em>what's stored in the data structures</em> has often been a source of
frustration.</p>
<p>In the javascript world, I've mostly used <a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone</a>  and
<a class="reference external" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for creating interactive web pages.  While these
tools are very good at what they do, I still find myself writing a fair amount
of code to update data in the model whenever a user interacts with a control, and
to update the control displays whenever data in the model changes.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Ractive</strong>.  It's not the only library to handle 2-way data binding - Angular,
Knockout and React all play in this space, but it's my current favourite.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a little demo....</p>
<p>Given a ractive template like this:</p>

     });

     ractive.on('changeme',function(){
        ractive.set('var1','zarniwoop');
     });
</script><p>Neat, huh?  I haven't had to write any code to manually react to keyup, or change events
in the input controls - Ractive simply takes care of the fact that I refer to <code class="code">
var1</code>

in both the output paragraph and the control value, and binds the two elements together,
refreshing them whenever needed.</p>
<p>The code for responding to the button click is simply:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">ractive</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;changeme&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>

<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>By setting data in the underlying model, the user interface automatically updates,
again without any manual intervention.</p>
<div class="section" id="ui-development-might-be-fun-again">
<h2>UI development might be fun again....</h2>
<p>I have the same feeling on discovering Ractive that I had when I was first shown
jQuery.  All of a sudden, a bunch of boring, fiddly manual tasks are taken care
of in an intuitive way.  And unlike other frameworks, <em>all</em> ractive does is data-binding.
It doesn't try to be a control library, an AJAX toolkit or a Model-View-Controller
framework.  For those who like all-in-one solutions, this will be a weakness, but as
someone who believes in the unix philosophy of building systems from tools that
each do one thing well, I'm very impressed.</p>

                <h2><a href="/nginx-uwsgi-ubuntu-14.html">Nginx and UWSGI on Ubuntu 14</a></h2>
                
                
                <div class="entry-content">

                    <p>The documentation for Nginx and UWSGI is long and complex, but with ubuntu 14
it's actually pretty straightforward to get them up and running.</p>
<p>I present here a a setup that uses nginx and uwsgi emperor to host
multiple python web applications simultaneously on an ubuntu 14 machine.</p>
<p>First, the packages</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install nginx
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install uwsgi uwsgi-emperor uwsgi-plugin-python
</pre></div>
<p>Our configuration files will now be under <code class="code">
/etc/nginx</code>
 and <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor</code>
</p>
<p>You can start, stop, and reload nginx as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo service nginx start
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo service nginx stop
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo service nginx reload
</pre></div>
<p>The last command is useful when changing configuration settings.</p>
<p>Now set up a site by creating a file in <code class="code">
/etc/nginx/sites-available</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#/etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite</span>
server<span class="o">{</span>

    server_name     your_host_name<span class="p">;</span>

    location /app1 <span class="o">{</span>
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/app1.socket<span class="p">;</span>
        include uwsgi_params<span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    location /app2 <span class="o">{</span>
        uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/app2.socket<span class="p">;</span>
        include uwsgi_params<span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Then,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/apps-available/mysite /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
</pre></div>
<div class="alert  alert-warning compound">
<p class="compound-first"><strong>Warning</strong></p>
<p class="compound-last">A previous version of this tutorial had the sockets placed in <code class="code">
/run/uwsgi</code>
.
This was a mistake, because under Ubuntu <code class="code">
/run</code>
 is mounted as a <code class="code">
tmpfs</code>
, and its content will be deleted on reboot
Your uwsgi sub-directory will vanish and the uwsgi services will not restart.</p>
</div>
<p>Next, set up your 'vassals' (<a class="reference external" href="http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Emperor.html">http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Emperor.html</a>)</p>
<p>Create  <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/app1.ini</code>
 as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">[uwsgi]</span>
<span class="na">plugin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">python</span>
<span class="na">processes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">2</span>
<span class="na">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/tmp/app1.socket</span>
<span class="na">chmod-socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">666</span>

<span class="na">chdir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app1</span>
<span class="na">wsgi-file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app1/main.py</span>

<span class="na">uid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
<span class="na">gid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And for your second application, create  <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/app2.ini</code>
 as similarly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">[uwsgi]</span>
<span class="na">plugin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">python</span>
<span class="na">processes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">2</span>
<span class="na">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/tmp/app2.socket</span>
<span class="na">chmod-socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">666</span>

<span class="na">chdir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app1</span>
<span class="na">wsgi-file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">/srv/app2/main.py</span>

<span class="na">uid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
<span class="na">gid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">www-data</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The simple act of <em>creating</em> or touching a .ini file in <code class="code">
/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals</code>
 will cause
the emperor process to try to restart your application.</p>
<p>Of course, your applications don't exist yet, so let's create them.  The simplest wsgi
application can be only a few lines long:</p>
<p>Create <code class="code">
/srv/app1/main.py</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;200 OK&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="s">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&#39;text/html&#39;</span><span class="p">)])</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello World, I am app1&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And <code class="code">
/srv/app2/main.py</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">env</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;200 OK&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="s">&#39;Content-Type&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">&#39;text/html&#39;</span><span class="p">)])</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&quot;I, however, am app2. &quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>Visiting <a class="reference external" href="http://your_host_name/app1">http://your_host_name/app1</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://your_host_name/app2">http://your_host_name/app2</a> should return the text
