                    Remote Systems Administration with Fabric
                </a>
            </h2>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <p>A tool I'm finding myself using more and more these days is <a class="reference external" href="http://fabric.readthedocs.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a>.</p>
<p>Fabric is a python utility and library for streamlining systems administration
tasks on multiple machines.</p>
<p>Although I'm primarily a developer and systems architect, I find that as our
company grows I keep getting drawn into sysadmin and devops tasks.   We now
have quite a number of servers which I need to monitor and manage.</p>
<p>Now, as Larry Wall so profoundly said, one of the great virtues of a programmer
is <em>laziness</em>, so if there's a way I can perform the same task on multiple machines
without having to manually type out the commands dozens of times, then I'm all for it.</p>
<p>Fabric does precisely that.  It's written in Python, and its configuration files
are python scripts, so there's no need to learn yet another domain-specific language.
I have a file called <code class="code">
fabfile.py</code>
 on my local machine that contains a growing
collection of little recipes, and with this I can interact with all the servers
in our infrastructure.</p>
<p>So for example, if I want to see at a glance which version of linux I'm running on
all my servers, I have a task set up in my fabfile like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@parallel</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">lsb_release</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;lsb_release -a&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When I invoke this via:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ fab lsb_release
</pre></div>
<p>I get a nice little print-out of the current version of all my servers.  Fabric
runs the task in parallel against every host in the <code class="code">
env.hosts</code>
 variable,
which can be set at the command line or in the <strong>fabfile</strong>.</p>
<p>The following example allows me to see a list of every database running on every
database server.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">DATABASE_HOST_MACHINES</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;dbserver1&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;dbserver2&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="nd">@hosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DATABASE_HOST_MACHINES</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">databases</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">warn_only</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;psql -c &quot;select datname from pg_database;&quot;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And <em>voila</em>, a call to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ fab databases
</pre></div>
<p>gives me a company-wide view of all our databases.</p>
<p>One further demonstration - this blog itself is generated using Fabric! For details, see

                    A Seriously Subtle Bug
                </a>
            </h2>

            <div class="content is-medium">
                <p>I build and maintain a number of web applications built using <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html">Bottle</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">uWSGI</a>.
In general, I've found this a very powerful and robust software stack.  However, this week
we encountered a very strange issue that took us many hours to fully diagnose.</p>
<p>Our first indication that something was wrong was when our automated monitoring tools warned
us that one of our sites was offline.  We manage our applications through the uWSGI <a class="reference external" href="http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Emperor.html">Emperor</a>
service, which makes it easy to restart errant applications.  Simply touching the config file for
the application in question causes it to be reloaded:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ touch /etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/myapp.ini
</pre></div>
<p>This brought our systems back up, but obviously didn't explain the problem, and over the coming weeks
it recurred several times, usually several days apart.  So, obviously my first step was to look at
the log files.   Our first indication of trouble was a log line from our database connection layer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>OperationalError: could not create socket: too many open files
</pre></div>
<p>Which actually led us away from the real cause of the bug to start with - at first we thought that
we were simply creating too many database connections.  But further examination reassured us that yes,
our database layer was fine, our connections were getting opened and closed correctly. Postgres has
<em>excellent</em> introspective tools, if you know how to use them; in this case the following is very
helpful:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">pg_stat_activity</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>which revealed that we had no more database connections open than expected.  So, our next step was the
linux systems administration tool <code class="code">
lsof</code>
.  This tool lists information about currently open files</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ sudo lsof &gt; lsof.txt

COMMAND     PID   TID       USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE  SIZE/OFF       NODE NAME
init          <span class="m">1</span>             root  cwd       DIR                8,1      <span class="m">4096</span>          <span class="m">2</span> /
init          <span class="m">1</span>             root  rtd       DIR                8,1      <span class="m">4096</span>          <span class="m">2</span> /
init          <span class="m">1</span>             root  txt       REG                8,1    <span class="m">265848</span>   <span class="m">14422298</span> /sbin/init
...
</pre></div>
<p>... followed by thousands more lines.  Armed with this information, we could figure out how many files
each process was using.</p>
<div class="section" id="enter-pandas">
<h2>Enter Pandas</h2>
<p>While it would be quite possible to search and filter this data using traditional Unix tools such as <code class="code">
awk</code>

and <code class="code">
grep</code>
, I'm finding that more and more I'm staying inside the python ecosystem to do systems administration
and analysis tasks.  I use the <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> data analysis library heavily, and it was a perfect fit for this particular task.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ ipython
</pre></div>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span>
<span class="n">widths</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">200</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">frame</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">pandas</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read_fwf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;lsof.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">widths</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">widths</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">frame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">columns</span>
</pre></div>
<pre class="literal-block">
Index([u'COMMAND', u'PID', u'TID', u'USER', u'FD', u'TYPE', u'DEVICE', u'SIZE/OFF', u'NODE', u'NAME'], dtype='object')
</pre>
<p>So now we have a DataFrame (a construct very similar to an Excel worksheet) with a list of every open file on the system, along
with the process id and name of the program that is holding it open.  Our next step was to ask Pandas to tell us which processes
had the <em>most</em> files open:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">frame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PID</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value_counts</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<pre class="literal-block">
2445     745
2454     745
...
</pre>
<p>So process <strong>2445</strong> has 745 open files.  OK, what is that process?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">frame</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">frame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PID</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="mi">2445</span><span class="p">][[</span><span class="s1">&#39;USER&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;COMMAND&#39;</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>
<pre class="literal-block">
          USER    COMMAND
3083  www-data  uwsgi-cor
3084  www-data  uwsgi-cor
3085  www-data  uwsgi-cor
...
</pre>
<p>So we've learned, then, that a uWSGI process belonging to www-data is holding open more than 700 files.  Now, under
Ubuntu, this is going to be a problem very soon, because the maximum number of files that www-data may have open
per-process is 1024.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$ sudo su www-data
$ <span class="nb">ulimit</span> -n
</pre></div>
<pre class="literal-block">
1024
</pre>
<p>So, clearly one of our web application processes is opening files and not closing them again.  This is the kind of
bug that I <em>hate</em> as a programmer, because it wouldn't show up in development, when I'm frequently restarting the
application, or even in testing, but only appears under real-world load.  But at least now we have a path towards
temporary remediation.  So first we simply increased the limits in <code class="code">
ulimit</code>
 so that the service would run longer
before this bug re-appeared.  But we still wanted to understand <em>why</em> this was happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-steps">
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Again, we used Pandas to interrogate the output of <code class="code">
lsof</code>
, but this time to find out whether there was a pattern
to the filenames that were being left open</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">frame</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NAME</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value_counts</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Which revealed to us that the the vast majority of the files being left open were ones that we were delivering through
our Bottle Python application. Specifically, they were being served through the <a class="reference external" href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#tutorial-static-files">static_file</a> function.</p>
<p>We verified this by hitting the url that was serving up those static files, and watching the output of lsof.  Immediately we
saw that yes, every time we served that file, the open count for that file went up.  So, we clearly had a resource leak
on our hands.  Now, this surprised me, because usually the memory management and garbage collection
in Python is excellent, and I've left the days of manually tracking resources in C long behind me.</p>
<p>So, next I constructed some test cases. Firstly, I ran our software on a test virtual machine to verify that I could
recreate the bug.  Then, I wrote a very bare-bones Bottle app that simply served a static file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bottle</span>

<span class="n">application</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Bottle</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nd">@application.get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/diagnose&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">static_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;cat.jpg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And I immediately saw that this <em>didn't</em> trigger any kind of file leak.  The main difference between the two was that our
production application uses Bottle's <em>mounting</em> capability to namespace URLS.  So I changed my test application as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">bottle</span>

<span class="n">app</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Bottle</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nd">@app.get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">static_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;cat.jpg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">rootapp</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">bottle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Bottle</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">rootapp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/diagnose&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>And   <code class="code">

 indicated that we <em>were</em> leaking files.  Every time I hit <cite>/diagnose</cite>, the open file count for <cite>cats.jpg</cite>
increased by one.</p>
<p>So, we could simply re-write our application to not use <code class="code">
Bottle.mount</code>
, but that wasn't good enough for me.  I wanted
to understand <em>why</em> such a simple change would trigger a resource leak.  At this point, it turns out it's good that
I have Aspergers, and with it a tendency to hyper-focus on interesting problems, because it took a long time.  In
fact, I ended up taking the Bottle library, and manually stripping it of every line of code that wasn't related to
simply handling that single URL, in an attempt to understand exactly what the different code paths were between the
leaking program and the safe one.</p>
<p>In doing so, I was greatly aided by the <em>amazing</em> introspective powers of Python.  We felt sure that we were
dealing with some kind of resource leak - in Python, every file is handled by a <code class="code">
file</code>
 object, and when that object
gets cleaned up by garbage collection, the underlying file handle is closed.  So firstly, I replaced the relevant call to
the <code class="code">
file</code>
 constructor with my own object that derived from <code class="code">
file</code>
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MonitoredFile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">file</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="nb">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__del__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;file.__del__({0})&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So this object behaves exactly like a regular file, but logs events when it is created and when it is destroyed.  And sure enough,
I saw that in the file-leaking version of my code, <code class="code">
MonitoredFile:__del__()</code>
 was never getting called.  Now in
Python an object should get deleted when its reference count drops to zero, and indeed the Python sys library provides
the <code class="code">
getrefcount</code>
 function (<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.getrefcount">https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.getrefcount</a>). By adding some logging statements
with calls to <code class="code">
sys.getrefcount()</code>
, I saw that in the leaking-version of my code, the refcount for our file object was
one higher than in the non-leaking code when it was returned from the main application handler function.</p>
<p>Why should this be?  Eventually, by stripping out all extraneous code from the Bottle library, I discovered that in the version
that was using <code class="code">
Bottle.mount()</code>
, the response object was passed twice through the <code class="code">
_cast()</code>
 function.  Bottle can
handle all sorts of things as response objects - strings, dictionaries, JSON objects, lists, but if it notices that it is handling
a <em>file</em> then it treats it specially.  The smoking gun code is here:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/854fbd7f88aa2f809f54dd724aea7ecf918a3b6e/bottle.py#L913">https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/854fbd7f88aa2f809f54dd724aea7ecf918a3b6e/bottle.py#L913</a></p>

<p>Which <em>looks</em> innocent enough, and indeed is in the first version of our code.  But in the <em>second</em> version, our file handler
gets passed through this code block twice, because it's getting handled recursively.  And, indeed, if <code class="code">
wsgi.file_wrapper</code>

isn't specified, then <code class="code">
WSGIFileWrapper</code>
 is used, and everything is fine.  But in our case, we're serving this application
via uWSGI, which <em>does</em> define <code class="code">
wsgi.file_wrapper</code>
.  Now, I'm still not 100% clear what this wrapping function is
<em>supposed</em> to do, but on inspecting the uWSGI <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/blob/ed2ca5d33325dc925f6fc5558d0b817447327049/plugins/python/wsgi_handlers.c#L463">source</a> I see that it is set to call this C function:</p>

<p>And we can clearly see that <code class="code">

presumably the internal reference count is incremented twice, but only decremented once elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>At the moment, I'm not exactly sure whether this is a bug or a misunderstanding.  I'm not sure what <code class="code">
wsgi.file_wrapper</code>
 is
supposed to do - I clearly have more research to do, time permitting.  And because this bug only occurred when Bottle and uWSGI
<em>interacted</em> -  I couldn't trigger it in one or other environment on its own - it's hard to say that either project has
a bug.  But hopefully this analysis will help prevent others from going through the same headaches I just did.</p>

                <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ractivejs.org/">Ractive.js</a> caught my eye this week.  I've been using <a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> for the last couple
of years to develop single page client-side applications, and I've liked how
it doesn't get in your way, but simply allows you to get on with your work.</p>
<p>When I noticed that three of the tools I was using: Coffeescript, Underscore, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> were all written by the same guy, I realised that Jeremy Ashkenas
is a seriously genius level developer.  I've loved working with his tools; and I
love the fact that the code that he produces is so readable.  I'm always more comfortable
working with a library when I can read through the entire source code if I run
into problems.  Check out the nicely annotated source code for Backbone, for example,
here: <a class="reference external" href="http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html">http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html</a></p>
<p>(On that note, I love working with <a class="reference external" href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/_modules/bottle.html">Bottle</a> for exactly the same reason - the entire
framework is contained in a single, very readable, Python file.)</p>
<p>But one problem that comes up time and time again, no matter what library or framework
you're using, is the problem of binding data to controls.  Currently in my Backbone-based
code I have event handling code that reacts to user input and updates the model, and
I have more code that reacts to changes in the data model and updates the UI.  Wouldn't
it be nice if this two-way data binding could happen automatically?  Wouldn't it be
nice, for example, if you could do something like this:</p>
<p>Imagine having a user interface like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;checkbox&#39;</span> <span class="na">checked</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;{{visible}}&#39;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> visible?
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">label</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And underlying data like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;visible&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And imagine if all the data binding was handled for you, so that clicking on the checkbox
will automatically change the value of the underlying javascript object, and changing
the value of the object via <code class="code">
ractive.set('visible',true)</code>
 updated the interface.</p>
<p>That is exactly what Ractive does.  I haven't tried using it in production yet, but
at the moment it feels like the next logical iteration in javascript frameworks.</p>
<p>I was busy using Backbone heavily when Angular and Knockout came out, so I don't have
much experience with them, but asking around the shop the consensus seems to be that
Ractive looks significantly nicer to use than Knockout.</p>
<p>And the best feature so far is their <em>awesome</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://learn.ractivejs.org/hello-world/1/">tutorial</a>.  This is, apparently, entirely
written in Ractive, and guides you step by step through all the basic concepts of
the library in an elegant, interactive fashion.  No more jumping through package installations
and dependency hell before you can try out a new framework.  <em>This</em> is the way to
introduce people to your work.  I'm very impressed.</p>
